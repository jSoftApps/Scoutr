This is a guide on setting up your database and users for Scoutr.

Scoutr uses MySQL for its database. You will need MySQL version 4.1.3 or later to properly run Scoutr.
The community edition of MySQL can be downloaded for free from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

Once you have a server set up, you must create a database. We recommend doing this in software such
as PHPMyAdmin. Once your database is created you must also create a user to go with the database, as
we don't want to use the root account for accessing the database. When you create your user, make sure
the user only has permissions to SELECT, UPDATE, and INSERT. Also make sure the user can only access
the database you have designated to Scoutr.

After this is done, while still logged in to the root account, run the file scoutr.sql (located in the
database folder.) This will set up your database to work with Scoutr.

We are currently working on adding support for more databases, (such as SQL Microsoft Server and 
postgresql) however, that is low on our current priority list. If you encounter any errors setting up 
the database, please email James Kienle (james@jsoftapps.com.)
