What is Scoutr?
===============
Scoutr is a free FRC scouting application. It's goal is to provide an easy, fast, and reliable scouting solution to all FRC teams. All of the scouting data is shared, so everyone can contribute to the database, which promotes teamwork between teams, and the sharing of ideas. Scoutr pulls all match data directly from the FRC's twitter account, so per-match scouting has been eliminated, giving teams an opportunity to actually watch games and cheer their team on instead of paying attention to statistics.
